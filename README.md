Learning to be the best of the best!

My name is kelsey and I'm a student at Saint Paul College in Minnesota. I'm studying Web Development and then planning on studying web design after I complete my degree. I like spending time at home, creating new projects and organizing data. I hope to work freelance or for firm one day. Currently ii work at hotel as the front desk agent.
